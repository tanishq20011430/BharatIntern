# BharatIntern Internship - Machine Learning Tasks
## 1. House Price Prediction
In this task, you tackled the challenge of predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. You likely explored various regression models, feature engineering techniques, and evaluated their performance to find the best model for predicting house prices accurately.

## 2. Wine Quality Prediction
The second task involved predicting the quality of wines using machine learning techniques. This classification problem might have required data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation to determine the most effective approach to predict wine quality.

## 3. Iris Classification
The third task revolved around classifying Iris flowers into their respective species based on their features. You likely implemented classification algorithms and assessed their accuracy to identify the most suitable model for the Iris classification task.

## Repository Structure
Your GitHub repository should be organized with separate directories for each task, containing relevant code files, datasets, and any additional documentation. Each task directory should have a clear and concise README explaining the purpose, approach, and results of that particular task.

## How to Run the Code
Include instructions on how to run your code to reproduce the results for each task. It's important to provide clear steps to ensure that others can easily understand and run your projects locally.

## Dependencies
List any specific dependencies or libraries required to run the code successfully. This helps users set up their environment without any issues.

## Acknowledgments
If you used any external resources, tutorials, or code examples, make sure to give proper credit and provide links to those sources in your README.
